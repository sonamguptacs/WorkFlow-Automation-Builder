# Workflow Automation Builder

A React-based workflow builder for creating, editing, and managing custom workflow automations. This app provides a drag-and-drop interface to connect and configure nodes such as tasks, approvals, and delays.

## Features

-  **Three Node Types**: Task, Approval, Delay.
-  **Inline Controls**: Add, edit, or delete directly on each node.
-  **Side Panel Configuration**: Click a node to open a React Hook Form to configure Task Name, Assignee, and Due Date.
-  **Summary Table**: View and edit all nodes in a tabular format with filtering and editing using React Table.
-  **Undo/Redo Support**: Revert or reapply actions like adding or deleting nodes/edges.
-  **Styled Components**: Clean and responsive UI styled using `styled-components`.
-  **Context API**: Centralized state management with React Context.
